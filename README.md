## Failure Detection ## 
### Purpose ###
This script aims to detect faulty areas in the print-job and colour-code them based on severity:
- obvious cracks and marks are red
- areas with miniature scratches that are more than 14 degrees from the vertical are yellow
- rest is green

The script aims to return the full area of the body, the percentage error of red, and the percentage error of yellow.
